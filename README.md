# Fingerprint Recognition System

## Overview
This project is a fingerprint recognition system utilizing the AS608 fingerprint sensor module and a PIC18F microcontroller. It provides the following functionalities:
- **Fingerprint Enrollment:** Register new fingerprints into the database.
- **Fingerprint Matching:** Identify stored fingerprints and trigger an LED upon a successful match.
- **Fingerprint Deletion:** Remove specific fingerprints from the database.
- **Status Display:** Display operation steps and results on an LCD screen.

This system is designed for applications requiring fingerprint authentication, such as access control.
